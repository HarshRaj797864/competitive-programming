# Contributing to Competitive Programming Solutions

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository contains my personal competitive programming journey, but I welcome contributions that can help improve the codebase and documentation.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Problem Solutions
- **Optimization**: If you find a more efficient solution to an existing problem, feel free to submit it
- **Alternative Approaches**: Different algorithmic approaches to the same problem are welcome
- **Bug Fixes**: If you spot any bugs in existing solutions, please report or fix them

### 2. Documentation
- **Problem Explanations**: Improve problem descriptions and approach explanations
- **Code Comments**: Add helpful comments to make solutions more understandable
- **README Updates**: Help improve documentation structure and clarity

### 3. Tooling & Scripts
- **Setup Scripts**: Improvements to the problem setup automation
- **Testing Framework**: Help build better testing and validation tools
- **Statistics Generation**: Enhance the stats tracking and README generation

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- **C++**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) and meaningful variable names
- **Comments**: Include time/space complexity analysis
- **Documentation**: Update README files for any new solutions

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
‚ú® Add optimized solution for Two Sum (LeetCode 1)
üêõ Fix edge case in Binary Search implementation
üìù Update documentation for Dynamic Programming section
üîß Improve problem setup script error handling
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create** a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/improvement-name`)
3. **Make** your changes with appropriate tests
4. **Update** documentation if needed
5. **Commit** your changes with clear messages
6. **Push** to your branch (`git push origin feature/improvement-name`)
7. **Submit** a pull request

### What to Include in PRs
- **Description**: Clear explanation of what you've changed and why
- **Testing**: Evidence that your solution works (test cases, complexity analysis)
- **Documentation**: Updated README or comments if applicable

## Code Review Process

All contributions will be reviewed for:
- **Correctness**: Solutions must be algorithmically correct
- **Efficiency**: Consider time and space complexity
- **Readability**: Code should be clean and well-documented
- **Style**: Consistent with existing codebase

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the environment**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/competitive-programming.git
   cd competitive-programming
   python3 scripts/simple_setup.py LeetCode example-problem 1
   ```

2. **Test your solution**:
   ```bash
   cd platform/LeetCode/example-problem
   python3 solution.py
   ```

3. **Run any existing tests**:
   ```bash
   # Add test commands here when available
   ```

## Questions or Suggestions?

Feel free to:
- **Open an Issue** for bugs, questions, or feature requests
- **Start a Discussion** for general questions about algorithms or approaches
- **Contact me** directly if you have specific questions about the codebase

## Recognition

Contributors will be acknowledged in the README and commit history. Thank you for helping make this repository better!

**Note**: This is primarily a personal learning repository, so major structural changes should be discussed in an issue before implementation.
