CodeChef #15802: A Needle in the Haystack
Tags: Ad-Hoc, Hash Maps, Sliding Window, Frequency Count, String Matching
Difficulty: Medium

Approach:
1. Count the frequency of each character in the pattern.
2. Use a sliding window of size equal to the pattern's length and scan the text string.
   - Track character frequencies in the current window.
   - Maintain a matched count to ensure characters are matching the pattern.
   - Shrink the window when it exceeds the pattern size, and update matched accordingly.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” as character set is fixed to 26 lowercase letters
